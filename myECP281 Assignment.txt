TOPIC: COMPARISON BETWEEN THE BRAIN OF A NINE YEARS OLD GIRL AND A MODERN COMPUTER, 
    • WHO IS MORE INTELLIGENT?
    • WHO HAS THE MORE POWERFUL BRAIN? 
    • WHO HAS MORE BRAIN SPEED?

All CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CLASS MEMBERS ON THE TOPIC STATED ABOVE

STUDENT- CONTRIBUTIONS

    • A girl of Nine years is able to think of new ideas in other to solve a problem, but a computer can only solve a problem on what it has be programmed to do.
    •  Someone used a rhetorical question to give the reason why a 9 year old is more intelligent. He asked: Between a wise man and a person who comes to a wise man for knowledge who is wiser? Definitely it is the wise man and that is why the person seeks knowledge from him. Likewise in the context of a 9 year old and a computer, assuming the 9 year old is an adult human being; the 9 year old would be more intelligent because it is the human being that manufactures and programs a computer, it is based on the knowledge we have that we produce and program the computer. So how can what depends on us be more intelligent than us?
    • In Artificial intelligence, Computer (Robots) is been programmed to do certain tasks but A nine year old child can perform unlimited tasks..
    • A genius beating Mohammed Ali in a fight without having to fight physically.
    • A nine year old girl can understand and input new information not known before but computers have a limited intelligence (limited to the given program) therefore,humans computers have a wider range of reasoning which means they can think of things as far as possible even something absolutely different from their origin and be a able to decipher it but computers can not, their intelligence is limited to the original program of the computers given by the programmer.
    • Humans have some form of electricity in their neurons and electricity is the only power of computers as they can not work without it, but humans do not need electricity to function, however according to science we have some electrical charge running in our neurons which do not need to be powered by electricity.
    • Computers only give out what they are given but can not give themselves additional instruction except a new program is written by a human but humans do not run under just a short instruction consistently, by research, experience, education, interest, they evolve into something better this is why a student who is very poor in his academics can eventually become the best student. This also explains why a footballer can become a boxer in a couple of months or years of consistent practice and dedication.




MY PERSONAL OPINION

    • Computers can take in and process certain kinds of information much faster than a girl child can.  They can swirl that data around in their “brains,” made of processors, and perform calculations to conjure multiple scenarios at superhuman speeds. For example, the best chess-trained computers can at this point strategize many moves ahead, problem-solving far more deftly than can the best chess-playing humans. Computers learn much more quickly, too, narrowing complex choices to the most optimal ones. Yes, a child also learn from mistakes, but when it comes to tackling the kinds of puzzles computers excel at, a child is far more fallible.

    • Computers have better memories, so they can be fed a large amount of information, and can tap into all of it almost instantaneously. Computers don’t require sleep the way a nine year old girl child will do, so they can calculate, analyze and perform tasks tirelessly and round the clock. Notwithstanding bugs or susceptibility to power blackouts, computers are simply more accurate at pulling off a broadening range of high-value functions than a girl child. They’re not affected or influenced by emotions, feelings, wants, needs and other factors that often cloud the judgement and intelligence of a mere mortals.

    • On the other hand, humans(Nine years old girl) are still superior to computers in many ways. A child perform tasks, make decisions, and solve problems based not just on our intelligence but on her massively parallel processing wetware — in abstract, what we like to call our instincts, our common sense, Computers can be programmed with vast libraries of information, but they can’t experience life the way we do. Humans possess traits we sometimes refer to (again, in the abstract) as creativity, imagination and inspiration. A nine years old child can write a poem, compose and play music, sing a song, create a painting or dream up a new invention. Computers can be programmed to replicate some of those tasks, but they don’t possess the innate ability to create the way humans do.

That being said, the class was insightful and absolutely enlightening as we have now understood the relationship and differences in a human’s way of reasoning and that of a child.
